# FAQ

**Can this mod break saves? How exactly does this mod affect my game?**
No, you can remove this mod from your game at any time without consequences. Your legacy launch pads will then work just like advanced launch pads. 

**Why isn’t/won’t this be on iOS?**
This mod uses features unable to HJSON. There are no workarounds. 

**How do I unlock the launch pad?**
It's unlocked with the advanced launch pad. 

**Why isn't it multiplayer compatible?**
This mod will cause desync. This problem can't be fixed. 

**Why isn’t this in the base game or a PR?**
This is much easier.
