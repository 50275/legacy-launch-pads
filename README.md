# FAQ
> **Why isn't this a part of the base game or a PR?**

Anuke didn't implement it. I'm not going to tell him to, and I can't do it myself since I don't know how to add UI buttons. 

> **Why isn't/won't this be on IOS?**

This mod depends on the following gamerule: `Planets.serpulo.campaignRules.legacyLaunchPads = true;` and I don't know how to do this in HJSON. 

> **How do I get launch pads with this mod?**

It's unlocked after the advanced launch pad and costs 1 copper. Could it be done better? Yes. Will it be done better? I don't think so. 

> **Why did you make this?**

Because people kept complaining in channels that I use. It's disruptive and this is my best solution. 

> **Why is it being flagged as a virus?**

I don't know.

To be clear I don't plan to play the campaign nor use this mod while doing so.
