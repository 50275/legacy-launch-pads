# FAQ

> **Can this mod break saves? How exactly does this mod affect my game?**
> No, this mod only makes launch pads behave like they do in V7. You can remove this mod from your game at any time without consequences. 

> **Why isn’t this in the base game or a PR?**
> It’s a design choice in vanilla. This mod just provides an alternative.

> **Why isn’t/won’t this be on iOS?**
> The mod relies on setting a campaign rule (Planets.serpulo.campaignRules.legacyLaunchPads = true), which isn’t doable with HJSON-only mods.

> **How do I unlock the launch pad?**
> It becomes available after researching the advanced launch pad. The cost is currently 1 copper.

> **Why was it flagged as a virus before?**
> Some antivirus software may misidentify the mod ZIP because it contains JavaScript. The contents are safe and limited to Mindustry’s modding environment.
