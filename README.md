# FAQ

> **Can this mod break saves? How exactly does this mod affect my game?**
> No. This mod will disable landing pads and make launch pads (including advanced launch pads) behave like they do in v146/v7 (add resources directly to core). Disabling this mod will restore v8 launch pad behavior. 

> **Why isn’t this in the base game or a PR?**
> It’s a design choice in vanilla. This mod just provides an alternative.

> **Why isn’t/won’t this be on iOS?**
> The mod relies on setting a campaign rule (Planets.serpulo.campaignRules.legacyLaunchPads = true), which isn’t doable with HJSON-only mods.

How do I unlock the launch pad?
It becomes available after researching the advanced launch pad. The cost is currently 1 copper.

Why was it flagged as a virus before?
Some antivirus software may misidentify the mod ZIP because it contains JavaScript. The contents are safe and limited to Mindustry’s modding environment.
